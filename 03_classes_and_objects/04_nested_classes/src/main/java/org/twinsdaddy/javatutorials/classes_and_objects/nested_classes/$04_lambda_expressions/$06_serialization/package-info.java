/**
 * <h1>Serialization</h1>
 * You can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/objects/serial.html">serialize</a> a lambda expression if its target type and its captured arguments are serializable.
 * However, like <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html#serialization">inner classes</a>, the serialization of lambda expressions is strongly discouraged.
